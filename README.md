EC601 Project: Material Considerations in Chiplet Design

Description:
This repository is for the EC601 project, Material Considerations in Chiplet Design.

Chiplets are small, specialized integrated circuits that can be combined inside a single package to create a complete system on chip (SoC)

Rather than being a singular, monolithic chip built on one continuous piece of silicon, chiplets can be thought of as building blocks that are interconnected to form a whole system

Chiplets allow for:
1. More design flexibility
2. Better yields in manufacturing
3. Low time-to-market

Material Considerations
My objective is to dive more into the implications of material properties on chiplet design, especially from the perspective of thermal impact

For issues caused by thermal limitations of ICs, I was particularly curious at how these problems are addressed in chiplets (as opposed to monolithic chip systems)

→ While this project is focusing specifically on chiplets, I wanted to use this opportunity to research and understand the thermal limitations of integrated chips, and then translate that into the trade-offs and design choices that could impact the performance, reliability, and scalability of chiplet-based systems

This project references the PAT-Noxim Simulator: https://github.com/amin-norollah/PAT-Noxim/blob/master/README.md#description

→ PAT = “Power, Area, Thermal”
→ Chiplet simulator that uses a power and thermal model to simulate a Network-on-Chip (NoC)
